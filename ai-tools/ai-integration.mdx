## Overview

TaskFlow supports state-of-the-art AI features to automate, classify, and optimize your workflow. This guide explains how to enable AI, configure models, interpret results, and follow best practices for integration into real-world projects.

**Supported Models:**
- GPT-4 Turbo
- Claude 3
- TaskFlow Classifier (in-house)

**AI Features:**
- Smart Task Classification
- Automated Summarization
- Effort Estimation
- Natural Language Query

## Getting Started

### Enable AI for Your Workspace

1. Go to **Settings > AI Integrations**
2. Toggle "Enable AI Features"
3. Select your preferred model (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3, TaskFlow Classifier)
4. (Optional) Enter your own API keys for third-party models
5. Save settings

### Permissions

- Only workspace admins can manage AI configurations
- All AI actions require explicit user confirmation before execution
- Your data is never shared or used to train third-party models by default

## Example Usage

### Automatic Task Classification

When you create or update a task, TaskFlow can automatically classify its type and urgency:

```json
{
  "title": "Fix login authentication bug",
  "description": "User authentication fails under load.",
  "ai_class": {
    "type": "bug",
    "priority": "high",
    "requires_action": true,
    "suggested_assignee": "Backend Team"
  }
}
```

### AI Summarization of Project Status

Use the `/summarize` command in Slack or the web dashboard:

```bash
/taskflow summarize project proj_123
```

**Example Output:**
> There are 8 active tasks, 2 overdue bugs, and sprint completion is projected for Friday.

### Effort Estimation with AI

After typing requirements, click "Estimate Effort with AI". Results are provided as:

```json
{
  "estimation": {
    "hours": 14,
    "risk": "medium",
    "dependencies": ["API access", "QA approval"]
  }
}
```

### Natural Language Command

You can ask TaskFlow AI assistant:
- "List all urgent bugs assigned to me"
- "When can we expect the next release?"
- "Summarize completed tasks last week"

### Model Configuration

#### Custom Model Settings

Each AI model can be tuned with the following parameters:
- `max_tokens` (response length)
- `temperature` (randomness, for creative tasks)
- `top_p` (probability threshold)
- `system_prompt` (role conditioning)

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
ai:
  model: gpt-4-turbo
  max_tokens: 1500
  temperature: 0.3
  top_p: 0.8
  system_prompt: "You are a helpful project assistant."
```

### Verification of Results

- Always review AI output before acting
- Use the "Explain Reasoning" button for justification and model decision breakdown
- For critical workflows, enable human-in-the-loop review

## Best Practices for AI Documentation

1. Clearly identify assumptions and dataset limitations
2. Always request explicit user approval before any irreversible change
3. Provide real example inputs and outputs for every AI feature
4. Document edge cases and fallback logic
5. Explain error codes and mitigation steps

## Error Handling

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE` | AI service is down or misconfigured | Check model, API key, and internet connectivity |
| `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE` | Input exceeds model limits | Reduce input size or split into parts |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Action not allowed | Check workspace permissions or contact admin |
| `AI_TIMEOUT` | Model did not respond in time | Try again or switch to a faster model |

## Privacy & Compliance

- No customer data is sent to third-party models unless explicitly allowed
- TaskFlow is GDPR and SOC 2 compliant for enterprise customers
- Audit logs are kept for all AI interactions
- Data retention settings can be customized under **Settings > Privacy**

## Feedback & Support

- Provide feedback on AI results using built-in thumbs up/down rating
- For issues, email ai-support@taskflow.com
- Security, privacy, and model bias concerns are handled with priority

<Note>
AI documentation should evolve with new features, models, and compliance requirements. Schedule regular reviews to maintain alignment with product capabilities.
