## Core Principles of Technical Writing

Effective technical documentation follows four foundational principles that ensure clarity and usability:

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Write to be understood, not to impress. Use simple, direct language that removes ambiguity.

<Tip>
**Good Example:** "Click the Save button to store your changes."

**Poor Example:** "Utilize the persistence mechanism to effectuate data retention."
</Tip>

### 2. Consistency in Terminology
Use the same term for the same concept throughout your documentation. Create a glossary for complex projects.

### 3. Audience-First Approach
Understand your reader's technical level and adjust accordingly. Never assume prior knowledge without stating prerequisites.

### 4. Actionable Content
Provide clear steps, commands, and outcomes. Users should always know what to do next.

## Best Practices for Professional Documentation

### Structure Your Content

- **Start with the "why"**: Explain the purpose before diving into details
- **Use hierarchical headings**: Create a logical flow from H1 to H4
- **Add a table of contents**: For documents longer than 3 sections
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell

### Writing Style Guidelines

  <Card title="Active Voice" icon="check">
    Use active voice for direct, engaging content.

## Annotated Code Example

Here's a well-documented API function that demonstrates professional technical writing:

```javascript authenticateUser.js
/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password credentials.
 * 
 * This function validates user credentials against the database and returns
 * a JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests. The token expires after
 * 24 hours and must be included in the Authorization header for protected routes.
 * 
 * @param {string} email - User's email address (must be valid format)
 * @param {string} password - User's password (minimum 8 characters)
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Authentication result object
 * @returns {string} result.token - JWT authentication token
 * @returns {Object} result.user - User profile information
 * @throws {AuthError} When credentials are invalid
 * @throws {NetworkError} When database connection fails
 * 
 * @example
 * const result = await authenticateUser('user@example.com', 'securePass123');
 * console.log(result.token); // "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
 */
async function authenticateUser(email, password) {
  // Validate input parameters
  if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
    throw new AuthError('Invalid email format');
  }
  
  // Query database for user record
  const user = await db.users.findByEmail(email);
  
  if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash)) {
    throw new AuthError('Invalid credentials');
  }
  
  // Generate JWT token with 24-hour expiration
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { userId: user.id, role: user.role },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '24h' }
  );
  
  return {
    token,
    user: {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name
    }
  };
}
```

### Why This Example Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Comprehensive JSDoc Comments">
    The function includes a detailed description, parameter types, return values, possible errors, and usage example.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Inline Explanations">
    Critical code sections have comments explaining the "why" not just the "what".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Documents all possible exceptions with clear error types.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Real-World Example">
    Shows actual usage with realistic data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before publishing any technical documentation:

- [ ] Content is organized with clear headings and hierarchy
- [ ] Code examples are tested and include output
- [ ] All technical terms are defined or linked to definitions
- [ ] Prerequisites are clearly stated upfront
- [ ] Common errors and troubleshooting are documented
- [ ] Examples include both success and error scenarios
- [ ] Sentences use active voice and present tense
- [ ] No assumptions about reader's prior knowledge
- [ ] All commands, parameters, and options are documented
- [ ] Content is reviewed for clarity by someone outside your team

<Note>
Remember: Great documentation is never "finished"—it evolves with your product. Schedule regular reviews and incorporate user feedback.
</Note>
